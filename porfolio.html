      <p>After four years of study at the Universidade Federal do Paran√°- Brazil, I became a teacher. The beginning of
        my carrer was difficult because I did not know yet the best procedures to apply with the children and how to
        assure the best learning on them.

      <p>As the years started to pass, I began to master my profession and understand what the students really nedded.
        This made me have a good name in the school I was working and led me to be able to influence certain decisions
        around the environment.

      <p>In my last few years as a teacher, I started to teach in a second language (English), what really opened new
        doors for me. I was about to shift my
        whole carrer on this new direction, making courses, studying and networking towards this nem path.

      <p>Life does not follow our plans, and in the begginning of 2018 I moved to Sydney, what closed definetly all the
        doors to my previous carreer. Since I was having the opportunity to become a whole new person, I decided to
        invest in a new lifestyle. And here I am: coding!</p>
